<h2> The Transfer Market </h2>

<p2>The transfer market is the marketplace where players 
    can buy or sell cards. Being the hub for most trading to occur, one must 
    know how this ecosystem works for in-game trade. Within FIFA each football 
    player has a unique card which can be considered as his base card. While players are given the freedom to create their club 
    consisting of various players. Each player can have various card types which will have an effect on their in-game stats. These special cards are usually 
    added in cycles to have a constant influx of content for the players in the game.
 Based on the rating of the player, there are 3 main types of cards. These are Gold, Silver and Bronze. Each of the following has a rating upto which they are capped at. For example, a Bronze card will have a max rating of 65 while silver will be at 72. There are another two types of cards which are rares and non-rares. In theory, the rare cards are tougher to get in-game.</p>

<h2>Squad Building Challenges</h2>
<p3> When players first create their Ultimate Team clubs in FIFA 23, there are fundamental Squad Building Challenges that introduce the mode, including how it works and setting people on their way. For those that have never used SBCs before, this is a must as it also covers the basics of the new chemistry system in FIFA 23. These challenges listed under the basic tab allow players to exchange players of low quality for low-rated packs, with the goal of getting used to the concept of SBCs. Further advanced challenges are available all year round, testing even the most advanced players while offering great rewards. If players have the cards in their Ultimate Teams to complete all of these SBCs, it is highly recommended to do so. A good strategy is always keeping the challenges in mind when opening rewards in FIFA 23. Tradeable rewards can be sold on the market for a profit, while untradeable can't. However, all cards, including untradeable ones, can be used in SBCs, meaning their value increases. It can be worth saving high-rated cards, especially ones 86 or greater specifically, to use in complete SBCs that require squads being a specific rating. Promotions can sometimes require several squads, including team ratings of 88 or 89, and these are the perfect opportunities to use high-rated players such as Keylor Navas (88), who will rarely be used in-game. By saving any high-rated cards, players have the possibility to turn them into that one superstar, such as a Player Of The Month, who can change a team in an instant. </p3>
